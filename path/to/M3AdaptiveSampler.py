"""
Planning/documentation module for a potential `M3AdaptiveSampler` implementation.

This file previously contained only stub classes, functions, and tests with `pass`
statements, and duplicated responsibilities that are implemented elsewhere in
the codebase (for example, in `llm_adapter/llm_core.py`).

To avoid exposing incomplete or misleading APIs and to satisfy static analysis
rules, all executable stub code has been removed from this module. If you need
an actual adaptive sampler implementation, use the existing, fully implemented
components in the main codebase rather than this planning file.

If you wish to keep design notes or planning sketches, please treat this file
purely as documentation and do not reintroduce stub classes or functions here.
